### Dev Container Features

This repository contains a collection of useful dev container features. These features can be used to easily set up a dev container that uses Ubuntu as its base image.

### Running tests

To run the tests, build the dev container and then run the tests using the `devcontainer` CLI:

devcontainer features test
```
